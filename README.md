# Machine Setup

Machine setup, powered by Ansible.  Finally got this simplified and cleaned up.

## Usage:

```console
$ wget https://github.com/ciscomonkey/machine/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master.zip
$ cd machine-master
```

If you need to edit anything, this is the time to do it.  Once done, run:

```console
$ ./setup
```

## Todo:

* Applications
  * Hazel
  * virtualenv and tools
* App Config files:
  * ST3
  * iTerm2
  * Git
* Add dev tools as needed
  * VirtualEnv
* Certificates?
* Licenses?
* Create ~/bin
  * Populate apps - They're in github right? ;D
* Create ~/dev
