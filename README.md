# Machine Setup

Machine setup, powered by Ansible.

I just got my new laptop and figured I should take the time to finally clean this up a bit and get ansible running for deployment.

Still needs some work:
* App Config files:
** ST3
** iTerm2
** Git
* Add dev tools as needed
** VirtualEnv

Apps/Utilities that we still need to add:
* Hazel

Misc:
* Certificates?
* Licenses for apps?
