# Machine Setup

Machine setup, powered by Ansible.

I just got my new laptop and figured I should take the time to finally clean this up a bit and get ansible running for deployment.

Still needs some work:
* ST3 configuration files
* iTerm2 configuration files
* Git configurations
* Add dev tools as needed.
