# Machine Setup

Machine setup, powered by Ansible.  Finally got this simplified and cleaned up.

Still needs some work:

* App Config files:
  * ST3
  * iTerm2
  * Git
* Add dev tools as needed
  * VirtualEnv

Apps/Utilities that we still need to add:

* Hazel

Misc:

* Certificates?
* Licenses for apps?
* Create ~/bin
  * Populate apps - They're in github right? ;)
* Create ~/dev
